Chitti: Your Conversational AI Assistant

Introduction

Chitti is a user-friendly, AI-powered conversational assistant designed to provide information, complete tasks, and engage in interactive dialogues. It leverages the power of Google's generative language model (Gemini) to understand your requests and generate informative responses.

Features

    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Chitti comprehends your questions and instructions in plain English.
    Conversational Memory: Chitti remembers past interactions to provide a more contextually relevant experience.
    Information Retrieval: Chitti can access and process information from the web using web scraping techniques.
    Text-to-Speech (TTS): Chitti can speak its responses aloud, enhancing accessibility and user interaction.
    Voice Recognition: Chitti can accept voice commands for hands-free interaction (optional).
    Graphical User Interface (GUI): Chitti provides a visually appealing interface for text input and output.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    tkinter
    google-api-python-client (for Gemini access)/distilgpt-2
    sentence-transformers (for memory encoding - optional)
    sklearn (for cosine similarity - optional)
    speech_recognition (for voice input - optional)
    PyAudio (for speech recognition - if using speech_recognition)
    gtts (for text-to-speech)/vosk/wishper
    pygame (for audio playback)
    beautifulsoup4 (for web scraping)
    requests (for web scraping)

Installation

    Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvisui.git
    Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (replace requirements.txt with the actual filename if different)

Usage

    Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE in os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual Google Cloud API key (required for Gemini access).
    Run the script: python jarvisui.py

Customization

    You can tailor the pre-loaded conversation data in the MemoryStore class for a more personalized experience.
    Feel free to modify the visual design of the GUI by editing the code in the JarvisUI class.
    Depending on your preferences, you can enable or disable voice recognition by adding/removing the related code sections.
